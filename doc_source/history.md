| Change | Description | Date | 
| --- |--- |--- |
| [Updated topic](#history) |  AWS CodeBuild now supports using an access token to connect to GitHub \(with a personal access token\) and Bitbucket \(with an app password\) repositories\. For more information, see [Create a Build Project \(Console\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/create-project.html#create-project-console) and [Using Access Tokens with Your Source Provider](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/sample-access-tokens.html)\.  | December 6, 2018 | 
| [Updated topic](#history) |  AWS CodeBuild now supports new build metrics that measure the duration of each phase in a build\. For more information, see [ AWS CodeBuild CloudWatch Metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/monitoring-builds.html#cloudwatch_metrics-codebuild)\.  | November 15, 2018 | 
| [VPC Endpoint Policy Topic](#history) |  Amazon VPC endpoints for AWS CodeBuild now support policies\. For more information, see [ Create a VPC Endpoint Policy for AWS CodeBuild](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/use-vpc-endpoints-with-codebuild.html#creating-vpc-endpoint-policy)\.  | November 9, 2018 | 
| [Updated content](#history) |  Topics have been updated to reflect the new console experience\.  | October 30, 2018 | 
| [Amazon EFS sample](#history) |  AWS CodeBuild can mount an Amazon EFS file system during a build using commands in a project's buildspec file\. For more information, see [Amazon EFS Sample for AWS CodeBuild](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/sample-efs.html)\.  | October 26, 2018 | 
| [BitBucket webhooks](#history) |  AWS CodeBuild now supports webhooks when you use BitBucket for your repository\. For more information, see [Bitbucket Pull Request Sample for AWS CodeBuild](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/sample-bitbucket-pull-request.html)\.  | October 2, 2018 | 
| [S3 logs](#history) |  AWS CodeBuild now supports build logs in an S3 bucket\. Previously, you could only build logs using CloudWatch Logs\. For more information, see [Create Project](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/create-project.html)\.  | September 17, 2018 | 
| [Multiple inpout sources and mulitple output artifacts](#history) |  AWS CodeBuild now supports projects that use more than one input source and publish more than one set of artifacts\. For more information, see [ Multiple Input Sources and Output Artifacts Sample](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/sample-multi-in-out.html) and [AWS CodePipeline Integration with AWS CodeBuild and Multiple Input Sources and Output Artifacts Sample](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/sample-pipeline-multi-input-output.html)\.  | August 30, 2018 | 
| [Semantic versioning sample](#history) |  The AWS CodeBuild User Guide now has a use case\-based sample that demonstrates how to use semantic versioning to create artifact names at build time\. For more information, see [ Semantic Versioning Your Build Artifacts Sample](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/sample-buildspec-artifact-naming.html)\.  | August 14, 2018 | 
| [New static website sample](#history) |  The AWS CodeBuild User Guide now has a use case\-based sample that demonstrates how to host build output in an Amazon S3 bucket\. The sample takes advantage of the recent support of unencrypted build artifiacts\. For more information, see [ Create a Static Website with Build Output Hosted in an Amazon S3 Bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/sample-disable-artifact-encryption.html)\.  | August 14, 2018 | 
| [Support for overriding an artifact name with semantic versioning](#history) |  You can now use semantic versioning to specify a format that AWS CodeBuild uses to name build artifacts\. This is useful because a build artifact with a hard\-coded name overwrites previous build artifacts that use the same hard\-coded name\. For example, if a build is triggered multiple times a day, you can now add a timestamp to its artifact name\. Each build artifact name is unique and does not overwrite the artifacts of previous builds\.  | August 7, 2018 | 
| [Support of unencrypted build artifacts](#history) |  AWS CodeBuild now supports builds with unencrypted build artifacts\.

| [Environment variables added to AWS CodeBuild documentation](#history) |  The [Environment Variables in Build Environments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-env-ref-env-vars.html) page was updated with the CODEBUILD\_BUILD\_ID, CODEBUILD\_LOG\_PATH, and CODEBUILD\_START\_TIME environment variables\.  | July 9, 2018 | 
| [Support for a finally block in the build spec file](#history) |  The AWS CodeBuild documentation was updated with details about the optional `finally` block in a build spec file\. Commands in the finally block always execute after the commands in its corresponding commands block\. For more information, see [Build Spec Syntax](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html#build-spec-ref-syntax)\.  | June 20, 2018 | 
| [AWS CodeBuild agent update notifications](#history) |  The AWS CodeBuild documentation was updated with details about how you can use Amazon SNS to be notified when new versions of the AWS CodeBuild agent are released\. For more information, see [Receive Notifications for New AWS CodeBuild Agent Versions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/use-codebuild-agent.html#receive-codebuild-agent-notifications)\.  | June 15, 2018 |
