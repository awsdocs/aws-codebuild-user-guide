+ **Latest API version:** 2016\-10\-06
+ **Latest documentation update:** October 22, 2018

| Change | Description | Date | 
| --- |--- |--- |
| [BitBucket webhooks](#history) |  AWS CodeBuild now supports webhooks when you use BitBucket for your repository\. For more information, see [Bitbucket Pull Request Sample for AWS CodeBuild](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/sample-bitbucket-pull-request.html)\.  | October 2, 2018 | 
| [S3 logs](#history) |  AWS CodeBuild now supports build logs in an S3 bucket\. Previously, you could only build logs using CloudWatch Logs\. For more information, see [Create Project](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/create-project.html)\.  | September 17, 2018 | 
| [Multiple inpout sources and mulitple output artifacts](#history) |  AWS CodeBuild now supports projects that use more than one input source and publish more than one set of artifacts\. For more information, see [ Multiple Input Sources and Output Artifacts Sample](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/sample-multi-in-out.html) and [AWS CodePipeline Integration with AWS CodeBuild and Multiple Input Sources and Output Artifacts Sample](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/sample-pipeline-multi-input-output.html)\.  | August 30, 2018 | 
| [Semantic versioning sample](#history) |  The AWS CodeBuild User Guide now has a use case\-based sample that demonstrates how to use semantic versioning to create artifact names at build time\. For more information, see [ Semantic Versioning Your Build Artifacts Sample](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/sample-buildspec-artifact-naming.html)\.  | August 14, 2018 | 
| [New static website sample](#history) |  The AWS CodeBuild User Guide now has a use case\-based sample that demonstrates how to host build output in an Amazon S3 bucket\. The sample takes advantage of the recent support of unencrypted build artifiacts\. For more information, see [ Create a Static Website with Build Output Hosted in an Amazon S3 Bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/sample-disable-artifact-encryption.html)\.  | August 14, 2018 | 
| [Support for overriding an artifact name with semantic versioning](#history) |  You can now use semantic versioning to specify a format that AWS CodeBuild uses to name build artifacts\. This is useful because a build artifact with a hard\-coded name overwrites previous build artifacts that use the same hard\-coded name\. For example, if a build is triggered multiple times a day, you can now add a timestamp to its artifact name\. Each build artifact name is unique and does not overwrite the artifacts of previous builds\.  | August 7, 2018 | 
| [Support of unencrypted build artifacts](#history) |  AWS CodeBuild now supports builds with unencrypted build artifacts\. For more information, see [Create a Build Project \(Console\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/create-project.html#create-project-console)\.   | July 26, 2018 | 
| [Support for Amazon CloudWatch metrics and alarms](#history) |  AWS CodeBuild now provides integration with CloudWatch metrics and alarms\. You can use the AWS CodeBuild or CloudWatch console to monitor builds at the project and account level\. For more information, see [Monitoring Builds](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/monitoring-builds.html)\.  | July 19, 2018 | 
| [Support for reporting a build's status](#history) |  AWS CodeBuild can now report the status of a build's start and completion to your source provider\. For more information, see [ Create a Build Project in AWS CodeBuild](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/create-project.html)\.  | July 10, 2018 | 
| [Environment variables added to AWS CodeBuild documentation](#history) |  The [Environment Variables in Build Environments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-env-ref-env-vars.html) page was updated with the CODEBUILD\_BUILD\_ID, CODEBUILD\_LOG\_PATH, and CODEBUILD\_START\_TIME environment variables\.  | July 9, 2018 | 
| [Support for a finally block in the build spec file](#history) |  The AWS CodeBuild documentation was updated with details about the optional `finally` block in a build spec file\. Commands in the finally block always execute after the commands in its corresponding commands block\. For more information, see [Build Spec Syntax](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html#build-spec-ref-syntax)\.  | June 20, 2018 | 
| [AWS CodeBuild agent update notifications](#history) |  The AWS CodeBuild documentation was updated with details about how you can use Amazon SNS to be notified when new versions of the AWS CodeBuild agent are released\. For more information, see [Receive Notifications for New AWS CodeBuild Agent Versions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/use-codebuild-agent.html#receive-codebuild-agent-notifications)\.  | June 15, 2018 |
