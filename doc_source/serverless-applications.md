# Use AWS CodeBuild with serverless applications<a name="serverless-applications"></a>

The AWS Serverless Application Model \(AWS SAM\) is an open\-source framework for building serverless applications\. For more information, see the [AWS serverless application model](https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model) repository on GitHub\.

You can use AWS CodeBuild to package and deploy serverless applications that follow the AWS SAM standard\. For the deployment step, CodeBuild can use AWS CloudFormation\. To automate the building and deployment of serverless applications with CodeBuild and AWS CloudFormation, you can use AWS CodePipeline\.

For more information, see [Deploying Serverless Applications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-deploying.html) in the *AWS Serverless Application Model Developer Guide*\.
