# Getting started with CodeBuild<a name="getting-started-overview"></a>

In the following tutorials, you use AWS CodeBuild to build a collection of sample source code input files into a deployable version of the source code\.

Both tutorials have the same input and results, but one uses the AWS CodeBuild console and the other uses the AWS CLI\. 

**Important**  
We do not recommend that you use your AWS root account to complete this tutorial\.
